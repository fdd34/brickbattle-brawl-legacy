# Brickbattle Brawl: Legacy Edition
This is an older version of Brickbattle Brawl. This game dates around mid 2017 when I was starting to take game development seriously. Though the code is relatively mediocre, I thought it would be worth publishing the source code here after not working on the project for 3 years. Surprisingly enough, the game still works relatively well (though with the occasional jank). And you can play it [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/6061920912/Brickbattle-Brawl-Legacy-Edition?refPageId=eb0c72ad-85a9-4288-a450-5063a6b0e865).

Developed by Chris. With help from shayne024 and Dawgra.
Compiled using [rbxlx-to-rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbxlx-to-rojo/releases).
